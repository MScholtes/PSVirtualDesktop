# Contributing

### Preamble

This project is open source, but not an open project. I am programming for fun in my spare time. According to the size of the project, I only adhere to a part of the guidelines for "good programming". Please respect this.

### How Can I Contribute?
- Reporting errors and suggestions for improvement is very welcome. Only use issues for this.
- Please do not make unasked pull requests, I will not use them, but might take code out of it (see preamble, don't steal my joy).
- Any code posted in this project must be free to use. This does not apply to the project owner.
- Trivial change requests such as renaming, reformatting, refactoring are not fulfilled.
